- ✅ **Input Validation**: All inputs validated and sanitized
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Secure error messages without sensitive data
- ✅ **Graceful Shutdown**: Proper cleanup on termination
- ✅ **Memory Protection**: Buffer overflow and memory leak prevention

## 🔒 How Your Credentials Are Protected

### Discord Bot Token Protection
```
1. Stored in .env file with 600 permissions (owner read/write only)
2. Never logged or exposed in error messages
3. Loaded via environment variables only
4. Validated on startup with proper error handling
5. Can be rotated easily without code changes
```

### Webhook Secret Protection
```
1. 64-character cryptographically secure random string
2. Used for HMAC-SHA256 signature verification
3. Required for all webhook requests
4. Timing-safe comparison prevents timing attacks
5. Automatically generated with secure script
```

### API Key Protection
```
1. 32-character secure random string
2. Required for sensitive endpoints
3. Validated on every request
4. Can be rotated without downtime
5. Rate limited per IP address
```

## 🚨 Attack Vectors Mitigated

### 1. **Token Theft Attempts**
- ❌ **Direct File Access**: `.env` file protected with 600 permissions
- ❌ **Log Injection**: Sensitive data masked in all logs
- ❌ **Error Disclosure**: Error messages don't expose tokens
- ❌ **Memory Dumps**: No tokens stored in plain text in memory
- ❌ **Network Sniffing**: All traffic encrypted with HTTPS

### 2. **Brute Force Attacks**
- ❌ **Rate Limiting**: 50 requests per 30 minutes in production
- ❌ **IP Blocking**: Fail2Ban automatically blocks abusive IPs
- ❌ **Signature Verification**: Invalid requests immediately rejected
- ❌ **Request Size Limits**: Large payload attacks prevented

### 3. **Injection Attacks**
- ❌ **Input Sanitization**: All inputs cleaned and validated
- ❌ **SQL Injection**: No direct database queries (if using database)
- ❌ **XSS Prevention**: Content Security Policy and input filtering
- ❌ **Command Injection**: No shell command execution

### 4. **Network Attacks**
- ❌ **Man-in-the-Middle**: HTTPS with strong cipher suites
- ❌ **DNS Spoofing**: Certificate pinning and validation
- ❌ **DDoS Attacks**: Rate limiting and connection limits
- ❌ **Port Scanning**: Firewall blocks unnecessary ports

## 📊 Security Levels by Environment
